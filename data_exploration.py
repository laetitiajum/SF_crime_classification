##### DATA EXPLORATION ######


### Load data and libraries

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

train = pd.read_csv("train.csv", sep = ",")

# get number of rows

### Categories of crime ###
###########################


#In this section, we aggregate some categories of crimes (initally 39) into 16 more global categories. 
#Indeed, this will be easier to visualize some potential relationships

# summary of variable Category
train.Category.describe()

# occurence of the observations
train.Category.value_counts()

# aggregate crimes into several categories : it is an arbitrary choice but still very useful

### Descriptive statistics ###
##############################

#We first summarize these categories of crimes using graphs (histograms, pies). 
#Then we segment it by neighborhood or by month of the year or day in the week


### GLOBAL
## How many crimes happened from the beginning ? 
## What is the proportion of each type of crimes ?



### PER LOCATION
## How many crimes occured in each neighborhood ? 
## What type of crimes ?

train.PdDistrict.value_counts()


# number of crimes for each neigborhood (histogram for ex with % !!)



# map and color neighborhood (red means "high percentage of crimes", yellow not many)



# build an histograms per neighborhood with the occurrence of different types of crime
# For example, in Richmond, 10% of crimes were DRUG, 24% were ROBBERY etc
# give a contingency table too (maybe too big)




# map of types of crimes using coordinates. Project each observation on the geographical coordinates. 
# I doubt we might find something interting but we should try





### PER TIME
## When do crimes mostly happen ? 

# create list of months / days related to the dates in the tableau


# Histogram : count percentage of crimes which happen on Monday versus Tuesday etc


# Lines : per month (maybe detect a seasonal effect?)



#If there is a month or day when crimes tend to happen more frequently, analyze which type of crimes.




#### Export data table into csv file
# export document as a csv file
f = csv.writer(open("train_v1.csv","w"))
# write column names
f.writerow(list(train.columns.values))
for i in range(nrow):
    f.writerow(list(train.ix[i]))
