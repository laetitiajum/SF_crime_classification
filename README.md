# SF_crime_classification
Kaggle Competition

The goal is to classify crimes according to the data, time, and place where it happened.

We plan to work according to the following steps :
- Data exploration : visualize where / when crimes occur, how many times per time period / neighborhood, etc.
- Classification : use of data mining techniques to predict where and when they could happen.
- Hopefully a search engine where we can type the neighborhood or time to get a statistics summary of crimes

This is a group project by two Columbia grad students : Laetitia JUMEL and Marie-Laura LUISADA


****************************************************

We have created broader crime categories, and displayed the number of crimes corresponding to those categories in the two charts below.
